Q: Is Hirschsprung disease a mendelian or a multifactorial disorder?
Reference: Coding sequence mutations in RET, GDNF, EDNRB, EDN3, and SOX10 are involved in the development of Hirschsprung disease. The majority of these genes was shown to be related to Mendelian syndromic forms of Hirschsprung's disease, whereas the non-Mendelian inheritance of sporadic non-syndromic Hirschsprung disease proved to be complex; involvement of multiple loci was demonstrated in a multiplicative model.
No RAG: Hirschsprung disease is a multifactorial disorder.

It is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors rather than following simple Mendelian inheritance patterns. Multiple genes likely contribute to its development, along with various environmental influences during fetal development. 
With RAG: Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a multifactorial, non - mendelian disorder. In the etiology of Hirschsprung disease various genes play a role; these are: RET, EDNRB, GDNF, EDN3 and SOX10, NTN3, ECE1. Mutations in these genes may result in dominant, recessive or multifactorial patterns of inheritance. The non - Mendelian inheritance of sporadic non - syndromic Hirschsprung's disease proved to be complex; involvement of multiple loci was demonstrated in a multiplicative model.

Q: List signaling molecules (ligands) that interact with the receptor EGFR?
Reference: The 7 known EGFR ligands  are: epidermal growth factor (EGF), betacellulin (BTC), epiregulin (EPR), heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF), transforming growth factor-α [TGF-α], amphiregulin (AREG) and epigen (EPG).
No RAG: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) can interact with several signaling molecules (ligands), including:
1. Epidermal growth factor (EGF): A small protein that stimulates cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation.
2. Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-α): A ligand that is structurally related to EGF and also activates EGFR.
3. Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF): This growth factor binds to EGFR and plays a role in various cellular processes, such as cell migration and survival.

These ligands bind to the extracellular domain of EGFR, leading to receptor dimerization and activation of its tyrosine kinase activity. This activation triggers a series of intracellular signaling pathways that regulate cell growth, survival, and differentiation.
With RAG: The signaling molecules (ligands) that interact with the receptor EGFR are:
- Epidermal growth factor (EGF)
- Amphiregulin (AR)
- Transforming growth factor alpha (TGFα)
- Heparin binding-EGF
- Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF)
- Betacellulin (BTC)
- Epiregulin (EREG)
- Epigen (EPG)

Q: Is the protein Papilin secreted?
Reference: Yes,  papilin is a secreted protein
No RAG: Papilin is a protein that is secreted. It is a major allergen found in the saliva of the common house dust mite, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. The secretion of Papilin by the dust mite is thought to play a role in the allergic response it induces in humans. When the dust mite secretes Papilin, it can trigger an immune reaction in sensitive individuals, leading to allergic symptoms such as itching, sneezing, and asthma. So, the answer is yes. 
With RAG: Yes, Papilin is secreted. Collagen IV, laminin, glutactin, papilin, and other extracellular matrix proteins were made primarily by hemocytes and were secreted into the medium. A sulfated glycoprotein was isolated from the culture media of Drosophila Kc cells and named papilin.

Q: Are long non coding RNAs spliced?
Reference: Long non coding RNAs appear to be spliced through the same pathway as the mRNAs
No RAG: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are spliced.

Similar to protein-coding genes, lncRNAs are transcribed from DNA into primary transcripts. These primary transcripts often undergo splicing, a process in which introns are removed and exons are joined together to form a mature, functional RNA molecule. Splicing helps to generate different isoforms of lncRNAs, which can have diverse functions in the cell, such as regulating gene expression at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, or epigenetic levels. 
With RAG: Yes, long non coding RNAs are spliced. Our analyses indicate that lncRNAs are generated through pathways similar to that of protein - coding genes, with similar splicing signals. For alternative exons and long noncoding RNAs, splicing tends to occur later, and the latter might remain unspliced in some cases.

Q: Is RANKL secreted from the cells?
Reference: Receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) is a cytokine predominantly secreted by osteoblasts.
No RAG: RANKL (Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-κB Ligand) is secreted from cells.

It is produced by various cell types including osteoblasts, osteocytes, and activated T lymphocytes. Secreted RANKL plays a crucial role in bone metabolism and immune responses by binding to its receptor RANK on osteoclast precursors and mature osteoclasts, promoting osteoclast differentiation, activation, and survival, which in turn affects bone resorption. 
With RAG: Yes, RANKL is secreted from the cells. Activated human T cells express alternative mRNA transcripts encoding a secreted form of RANKL. Osteoblasts also secrete RANKL. Source: test.json | chunk_id: 10, test.json | chunk_id: 11

Q: Does metformin interfere thyroxine absorption?
Reference: No. There are not reported data indicating that metformin reduce with thyroxine absorption.
No RAG: Metformin does not interfere with thyroxine absorption.

Metformin is an oral antidiabetic drug, mainly acting on the liver, muscle and adipose tissue to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce blood glucose levels. Thyroxine is a hormone replacement drug used to treat hypothyroidism. There is no evidence to suggest that metformin affects the absorption, metabolism or efficacy of thyroxine.

However, when taking these two drugs simultaneously, it is still necessary to pay attention to observing the body's reaction and regularly review relevant indicators to ensure the safety and effectiveness of drug use. If there are any concerns or questions, it is advisable to consult a doctor or pharmacist for professional advice. 
With RAG: LT4 absorption is unchanged by concomitant metformin ingestion. Source: test.json | chunk_id: 12

Q: Which miRNAs could be used as potential biomarkers for epithelial ovarian cancer?

5. miR-375: This miRNA is downregulated in epithelial ovarian cancer and may be involved in tumorigenesis through its effects on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration.

These are just a few examples of miRNAs that have been investigated as potential biomarkers for epithelial ovarian cancer. The dysregulation of miRNAs can provide valuable information about the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response of the disease. However, further research is needed to validate their clinical utility and develop reliable miRNA-based diagnostic and prognostic tools.

It's important to note that miRNA expression profiles can vary among different patients and tumor subtypes, and the identification of specific miRNA biomarkers may require comprehensive analysis of large patient cohorts. Additionally, the combination of multiple miRNAs or miRNA signatures may provide more accurate and robust diagnostic and prognostic information.

In conclusion, miRNAs have the potential to be used as valuable biomarkers for epithelial ovarian cancer, but their translation into clinical practice requires further investigation and validation.
With RAG: The following miRNAs could be used as potential biomarkers for epithelial ovarian cancer:
- miR-21: Serum miR-21 levels were significantly higher in EOC patients than in healthy controls.

(Source: test.json | chunk_id: 17)
- miR-510 and miR-509-5p: May be considered novel-candidate clinical biomarkers for predicting OSC outcome as low miR-510 expression, low miR-509-5p expression, and advanced FIGO stage, and chemotherapy resistance were significantly associated with poorer overall survival. (Source: test.json | chunk_id: 14, 15)
- let-7a: The beneficial impact of the addition of paclitaxel on EOC survival was significantly linked to let-7a levels, suggesting it may be a useful marker for selection of chemotherapeutic agents in EOC management. (Source: test.json | chunk_id: 18)
- let-7i: Might be used as a therapeutic target to modulate platinum-based chemotherapy and as a biomarker to predict chemotherapy response and survival in patients with ovarian cancer. (Source: test.json | chunk_id: 18)

Q: Which acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are used for treatment of myasthenia gravis?
Reference: Pyridostigmine and neostygmine are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors that are used as first-line therapy for symptomatic treatment of myasthenia gravis. Pyridostigmine is the most widely used acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Extended release pyridotsygmine and novel acetylcholinesterase inhibitors inhibitors with oral antisense oligonucleotides are being studied.
No RAG: The following acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are commonly used in the treatment of myasthenia gravis:
- **Neostigmine**: It is one of the most frequently used drugs. It helps increase the levels of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, improving muscle strength.
- **Pyridostigmine**: This is also a widely employed acetylcholinesterase inhibitor for myasthenia gravis. It has a relatively longer duration of action compared to some other agents. 
With RAG: Pyridostigmine is the most widely used acetylcholinesterase inhibitor for the treatment of myasthenia gravis. It has been used for over 50 years and is generally considered safe. It is suitable as a long-term treatment in patients with generalized non-progressive milder disease, and as an adjunctive therapy in patients with severe disease who are also receiving immunotherapy.

Q: Which are the classes of anti-arrhythmic drugs according to Vaughan-Williams classification?
Reference: Antiarrhythmic drugs can be divided into four Vaughan Williams classes (I-IV). Class I antiarrhythmic agents have as a common action, blockade of the sodium channels. Class II agents are antisympathetic drugs, particularly the beta-adrenoceptor blockers. Class-III antiarrhythmics have as a common action the potassium-channel blockade. Class IV antiarrhythmic drugs are calcium channel blockers.
No RAG: The Vaughan - Williams classification divides anti - arrhythmic drugs into the following classes:

**Class I: Sodium channel blockers**
- **Class IA**: Moderate sodium channel blockers. Examples include quinidine, procainamide, and disopyramide. They also have some potassium channel blocking effects, which prolong the action potential duration.
- **Class IB**: Mild sodium channel blockers. Such as lidocaine, mexiletine. They have a relatively short duration of action and are more effective against abnormal automaticity.
- **Class IC**: Strong sodium channel blockers with slow dissociation. For example, flecainide, propafenone. They have a long - lasting effect on sodium channels and are useful in treating supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias.

**Class II: β - blockers**
Examples are propranolol, atenolol, metoprolol. They act by blocking β - adrenergic receptors, reducing the influence of sympathetic nervous system on the heart, and are effective in treating arrhythmias related to increased sympathetic tone, such as supraventricular tachycardia and some ventricular arrhythmias.

**Class III: Potassium channel blockers**
- Amiodarone, sotalol. They prolong the action potential duration by blocking potassium channels, which is beneficial for treating various types of arrhythmias, especially atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, etc.

**Class IV: Calcium channel blockers**
Verapamil and diltiazem are examples. They block calcium channels, mainly affecting the slow calcium current in myocardial cells. They are effective in treating supraventricular arrhythmias, such as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.

**Others**
- **Class V**: This class includes drugs that do not fit into the previous four classes, such as adenosine. Adenosine acts on specific adenosine receptors in the heart to rapidly terminate certain supraventricular tachycardias. 
With RAG: Antiarrhythmic drugs can be divided into four Vaughan Williams classes (I-IV) according to defined electrophysiological effects on the myocardium. Class I antiarrhythmic agents include most of the drugs traditionally thought of as antiarrhythmics, and have as a common action, blockade of the fast-inward sodium channel on myocardium. Class II agents are antisympathetic drugs, particularly the beta-adrenoceptor blockers. Class III antiarrhythmic agents include sotalol and amiodarone. Class IV antiarrhythmic drugs are the calcium channel blockers verapamil and diltiazem.

Q: Which are the different isoforms of the mammalian Notch receptor?
Reference: Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism, used to regulate cell fate decisions. Four Notch receptors have been identified in man: Notch-1, Notch-2, Notch-3 and Notch-4.
No RAG: There are four different isoforms of the mammalian Notch receptor: Notch1, Notch2, Notch3, and Notch4. Each isoform has distinct functions and expression patterns in different tissues and developmental processes.

Q: Which are the major characteristics of cellular senescence?
Reference: The defining characteristics of cellular senescence are altered morphology, arrested cell-cycle progression, development of aberrant gene expression with proinflammatory behavior, and telomere shortening.
No RAG: Cellular senescence is a complex biological process with several major characteristics:

**1. Irreversible growth arrest**
   - Cells enter a state where they can no longer divide. This is often accompanied by changes in the cell cycle machinery. For example, there is a stable arrest in the G1 phase, which is regulated by the activation of cell cycle inhibitors such as p53 and p21.
   - The expression of genes involved in DNA replication and cell cycle progression is downregulated, while genes associated with a quiescent state are upregulated.

**2. Senescence - associated secretory phenotype (SASP)**
   - Senescent cells secrete a complex mixture of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and proteases.
   - This includes interleukin - 6 (IL - 6), tumor necrosis factor - alpha (TNF - α), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The SASP can have both autocrine and paracrine effects. Autocrine signaling can further reinforce the senescent phenotype, while paracrine effects can influence neighboring cells, the extracellular matrix, and the overall tissue environment. It can contribute to chronic inflammation, tissue remodeling, and potentially play a role in age - related diseases and cancer development.

**3. Morphological changes**
   - Cells often show enlarged and flattened morphology.
   - There are also changes in the structure of the cytoplasm, with increased vacuolization. In addition, the nucleus may become enlarged and exhibit chromatin alterations, such as increased heterochromatinization.

**4. Metabolic alterations**
   - There are changes in cellular metabolism. Senescent cells tend to have a decreased rate of oxidative phosphorylation and an increased reliance on glycolysis, even in the presence of oxygen (a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect).
   - They also show alterations in nutrient sensing pathways, such as the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which can affect protein synthesis, autophagy, and cell survival.

**5. Lysosomal and mitochondrial dysfunction**
   - Lysosomes in senescent cells may exhibit increased membrane permeability and abnormal enzyme activity. This can lead to the release of lysosomal hydrolases, which can contribute to the degradation of cellular components and the activation of inflammatory pathways.
   - Mitochondria in senescent cells often show morphological changes, such as swelling, and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential. There is also a decrease in mitochondrial DNA content and respiratory chain function, leading to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The elevated ROS levels can further damage cellular components and contribute to the senescent phenotype. 
With RAG: The major characteristics of cellular senescence are arrested cell-cycle progression and the development of aberrant gene expression with proinflammatory behavior. Source: [1]

Q: Orteronel was developed for treatment of which cancer?

We assessed orteronel in chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. 

Q: Is the monoclonal antibody Trastuzumab (Herceptin) of potential use in the treatment of prostate cancer?
Reference: Although is still controversial, Trastuzumab (Herceptin) can be of potential use in the treatment of prostate cancer overexpressing HER2, either alone or in combination with other drugs.
No RAG: Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is not typically of direct use in the treatment of prostate cancer.

Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). It is mainly used in the treatment of certain breast cancers where there is overexpression of HER2.

Prostate cancer does not usually involve the HER2 pathway in the same way as the breast cancers for which Herceptin is indicated. Treatment of prostate cancer typically involves approaches such as surgery, hormonal therapy (e.g., androgen deprivation), chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, which are tailored to the specific biology and characteristics of prostate cancer cells. 
With RAG: There is evidence suggesting that trastuzumab may have potential in treating prostate cancer, but there are also limitations. Some studies indicate that the docetaxel/trastuzumab combination may be an effective therapeutic approach for HER2-expressing hormone-refractory prostate cancer. However, there is no clinical data to support the use of trastuzumab for prostate cancer patients. Trastuzumab as a single agent demonstrated poor efficacy in treating HRPC. Also, conclusions regarding the predictive value of HER-2 status on outcome after trastuzumab-based therapy were not reached without larger-scale screening efforts.

Q: Which currently known mitochondrial diseases have been attributed to POLG mutations?
Reference: Mutations in the POLG gene have emerged as one of the most common causes of inherited mitochondrial disease in children and adults. They are responsible for a heterogeneous group of at least 6 major phenotypes of neurodegenerative disease that include: 1) childhood Myocerebrohepatopathy Spectrum disorders (MCHS), 2) Alpers syndrome, 3) Ataxia Neuropathy Spectrum (ANS) disorders, 4) Myoclonus Epilepsy Myopathy Sensory Ataxia (MEMSA), 5) autosomal recessive Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (arPEO), and 6) autosomal dominant Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (adPEO).
No RAG: POLG mutations have been associated with several mitochondrial diseases, including:
1. Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome: A severe neurological disorder characterized by progressive liver failure, epilepsy, and developmental regression.
2. Progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) with mitochondrial DNA depletion: PEO is characterized by weakness of the eye muscles, and mitochondrial DNA depletion is a common feature in some cases associated with POLG mutations.
3. Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF) syndrome: Although MERRF is typically associated with mitochondrial DNA mutations, some cases have been linked to POLG mutations.
4. Ataxia-neuropathy syndrome: This syndrome is characterized by ataxia (uncoordinated movements), neuropathy (nerve damage), and other neurological symptoms.
5. Infantile-onset spinocerebellar ataxia: A rare neurological disorder that affects the cerebellum and spinal cord, leading to progressive motor problems.
6. Pearson syndrome: A disorder that typically presents with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, anemia, and mitochondrial abnormalities.
7. Multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome (MMDS): MMDS is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by multiple mitochondrial abnormalities, and some cases are associated with POLG mutations.

It's important to note that the clinical manifestations of POLG-related mitochondrial diseases can vary widely, even within the same family, and the diagnosis often requires a combination of clinical, biochemical, and genetic testing. Additionally, new cases and subtypes of POLG-related diseases are still being discovered as our understanding of mitochondrial genetics and disease mechanisms continues to evolve. If you have specific concerns or questions about a particular mitochondrial disease or POLG mutations, it is advisable to consult with a geneticist or a specialist in mitochondrial medicine for personalized information and guidance.
With RAG: Mutations in the POLG gene have been associated with a mitochondrial disease - autosomal dominant or recessive progressive external ophthalmoplegia - and multiple deletions of mtDNA.

Q: What is the effect of ivabradine in heart failure after myocardial infarction?
Reference: Ιvabradine decreases heart rate and reduces myocardial oxygen demand, increases diastolic perfusion time and improves energetics in ischemic myocardium. Ivabradine protects the myocardium during ischemia, improves left ventricular function in heart failure and reduces remodeling following myocardial infarction. It improves prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease, left ventricular dysfunction and heart rate ≥70 beats per minute, as well as in patients with heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction. The beneficial effects of ivabradine may be due to the reversal of electrophysiological cardiac remodelling in post-MI rats by reduction of functional overexpression of HCN channels. Furthermore, the improvement of cardiac function is related not only to the HR reduction per se but also to modifications in the extracellular matrix.
No RAG: Ivabradine has the following effects in heart failure after myocardial infarction:

### 1. Heart rate reduction
- **Mechanism**: Ivabradine selectively inhibits the If current (funny current) in the sinoatrial node. By reducing the If current, it slows the spontaneous diastolic depolarization of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node, thereby decreasing the heart rate.
- **Benefit**: In patients with heart failure after myocardial infarction, a lower heart rate can reduce myocardial oxygen demand. This is particularly important as the heart muscle has already been damaged by the infarction, and excessive oxygen consumption due to a high heart rate can further strain the heart. A reduced heart rate allows the heart to have more time for diastolic filling, which can improve cardiac output and cardiac efficiency.

### 2. Improvement in cardiac function
- **Enhanced diastolic function**: The reduction in heart rate helps to improve diastolic function. Adequate diastolic filling is crucial for maintaining cardiac output. With a slower heart rate, the heart has more time to relax and fill with blood during diastole, which can lead to an increase in end - diastolic volume and ultimately improve stroke volume and cardiac output.
- **Reduced myocardial remodeling**: Chronic elevation of heart rate is associated with adverse myocardial remodeling. By lowering the heart rate, ivabradine may help to attenuate the process of myocardial remodeling. This can involve reducing myocardial fibrosis, preserving myocardial structure, and potentially improving the long - term prognosis of heart failure patients after myocardial infarction.

### 3. Mortality and morbidity reduction
- **Mortality**: Studies have shown that ivabradine can reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality in patients with heart failure after myocardial infarction, especially in those with a heart rate above a certain threshold (usually ≥70 beats per minute). By improving cardiac function and reducing the workload on the damaged heart, it may contribute to better survival.
- **Morbidity**: It can also lead to a reduction in hospitalizations for heart failure exacerbations. By maintaining relatively stable cardiac function, patients experience fewer decompensations, which improves their quality of life and reduces the economic burden associated with repeated hospitalizations. 
With RAG: Ivabradine protects the myocardium during ischemia, improves left ventricular function in heart failure and reduces remodeling following myocardial infarction. It improves prognosis in patients with heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction. Addition of ivabradin to standard treatment of SCCF after MI promoted less frequency of hospitalizations, recurrent non - fatal MI, fatal cardiovascular events. This effect was especially strong in high baseline HR.

Q: What is the mode of inheritance of Wilson's disease?
Reference: Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder.
No RAG: Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder.

In autosomal recessive inheritance, an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the disease. Carriers have one normal and one mutated copy of the gene and do not show symptoms of the disease but can pass the mutated gene on to their offspring. 
With RAG: Wilson's disease has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. This means that inheritance of a pair of alleles of an autosomal recessive gene on chromosome 13 is necessary and sufficient to cause copper accumulation in the disease. When familial, it is inherited recessively and has been linked to chromosome 20. Autosomal recessive inheritance indicates that siblings of affected patients are at 25% risk of having the disease. The autosomal recessive mode of inheritance strongly suggests that mutation of a single gene causes the impairment of both caeruloplasmin synthesis and biliary copper excretion.

Q: Are transcription and splicing connected?
Reference: Yes. There is strong evidence that splicing and transcription are intimately coupled in metazoans, with  genome wide surveys show that most splicing occurs during transcription. Chromatin structure, RNA polymerase dynamics, and recruitment of splicing factors through the transcriptional machinery are factors that explain a role for transcription in the regulation of splicing.
No RAG: Transcription and splicing are connected.

During transcription, an RNA molecule is synthesized from a DNA template. In eukaryotes, the initial RNA transcript, called pre - mRNA, often contains non - coding regions known as introns interspersed with coding regions called exons. Splicing then occurs, which is the process of removing the introns and joining the exons together to form a mature mRNA molecule that can be translated into a protein.

So, splicing is a crucial step that follows transcription and modifies the product of transcription to generate a functional mRNA for translation.
With RAG: Yes, transcription and splicing are connected. Splicing regulation depends on transcription-associated features such as protein recruitment to the transcribing machinery and elongation kinetics. Chromatin structure, which is involved in transcription regulation, also affects splicing through various mechanisms. The rate of transcription elongation has been linked to alternative splicing. Moreover, cotranscriptional splicing occurs efficiently in Drosophila, and there is a kinetic link between transcription, splicing factor recruitment, and splicing catalysis. Transcription factors are present in the spliceosome, and proteins with dual activities in splicing and transcription add a new level of complexity to the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes.

Q: What is the mode of inheritance of Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD)?
Reference: Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.
No RAG: Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.

In autosomal dominant inheritance, a single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the disorder. This means that an affected individual has a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene on to each of their offspring.

FSHD is caused by mutations in the D4Z4 repeat region on chromosome 4. These mutations lead to abnormal gene expression and muscle weakness, which typically affects the facial, shoulder, and upper arm muscles.

The inheritance pattern of FSHD can be complex, as there are different types of mutations and variable expression of the disease within families. Some individuals may have a milder form of the disorder, while others may experience more severe symptoms.

Genetic testing can be used to confirm the diagnosis of FSHD and to identify the specific mutation in affected individuals. This information can be helpful for genetic counseling and family planning.

In summary, Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, with a single copy of the mutated gene causing the disorder.
With RAG: Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.

Q: Is Alu hypomethylation associated with breast cancer?
Reference: Yes, Alu elements were found to be hypomethylated in breast cancer, especially in the HER2-enriched subtype. Furthermore, Alu hypomethylation was identified as a late event during breast cancer progression, and in invasive breast cancer, tended to be associated with negative estrogen receptor status and poor disease-free survival of the patients.
No RAG: Alu hypomethylation is associated with breast cancer.

Alu elements are repetitive DNA sequences in the genome. Hypomethylation of Alu elements has been observed in various cancers, including breast cancer. This hypomethylation can lead to increased Alu element transcription and subsequent genomic instability, potentially contributing to cancer development and progression. Altered methylation patterns of Alu elements are thought to be involved in processes such as gene regulation dysregulation, activation of oncogenes, and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes in breast cancer. 
With RAG: Yes, Alu hypomethylation is associated with breast cancer. Alu and LINE-1 hypomethylation is associated with HER2 enriched subtype of breast cancer. In IBC, Alu hypomethylation correlated with negative estrogen receptor (ER) status. In survival analyses, low Alu methylation status tended to be associated with poor disease-free survival of the patients. Alu hypomethylation is probably a late event during breast cancer progression and prominent hypomethylation of Alu and LINE-1 in HER2 enriched subtype may be related to chromosomal instability of this specific subtype. DNA methylation for three repetitive elements (LINE1, Sat2 and Alu) were analyzed in invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, paired adjacent normal tissue and WBC from 40 breast cancer patients and DNA methylation for the three repetitive elements was lower in tumor compared to adjacent tissue and WBC DNA.

Q: Which proteins participate in the formation of the ryanodine receptor quaternary macromolecular complex?
Reference: Junctin is a major transmembrane protein in cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum, which forms a quaternary complex with the ryanodine receptor (Ca(2+) release channel), triadin, and calsequestrin.   
No RAG: The ryanodine receptor quaternary macromolecular complex is formed by the ryanodine receptor itself along with other associated proteins such as FKBP12 (FK506-binding protein 12). FKBP12 binds to the ryanodine receptor and modulates its function. Additionally, calstabin1 (also known as FKBP12.6) is another important protein that is part of this complex and plays a role in stabilizing and regulating the activity of the ryanodine receptor. 
With RAG: Junctin, calsequestrin, and triadin participate in the formation of the ryanodine receptor quaternary macromolecular complex.

Q: What kind of chromatography is HILIC?
Reference: Hydrophilic Interaction Chromatography (HILIC)
No RAG: HILIC stands for hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography. It is a type of liquid chromatography.

In HILIC, the stationary phase is polar, while the mobile phase is relatively less polar. Analytes interact with the polar stationary phase based on hydrophilic interactions. It is particularly useful for separating polar compounds such as carbohydrates, peptides, and small polar molecules. HILIC can be complementary to reversed-phase chromatography and is often employed in various analytical applications, including drug analysis, metabolite profiling, and separation of biomolecules. 
With RAG: Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) is a widely used technique for small polar molecule analysis. It is a type of chromatography where a hydrophilic interaction chromatographic (HILIC) method is used. In the study mentioned, a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC LC-MS/MS) method is employed.

Q: What is the effect of TRH on myocardial contractility?
Reference: TRH improves myocardial contractility
No RAG: TRH (thyrotropin-releasing hormone) can have a positive inotropic effect on myocardial contractility.

TRH acts on the myocardium directly or indirectly through its actions on the thyroid axis and other regulatory systems. It may increase the availability of calcium ions within the myocardial cells, which are crucial for muscle contraction. By enhancing the contractile machinery and promoting more efficient calcium handling, TRH can lead to an increase in the force of myocardial contraction. This can contribute to maintaining cardiac output and overall cardiovascular function under certain physiological or pathophysiological conditions. 
With RAG: TRH can enhance cardiomyocyte contractility in vivo. It improves mean arterial pressure (MAP) and myocardial contractility (dp/dtmax, -dp/dtmax, Vpm, and Vmax). TRH increases the contractile force of muscles dose-dependently without changing the time course of contraction. It potentiates the response of contractile force to increasing extracellular Ca2+ concentration and has a positive inotropic effect at least partly due to an increase in the slow inward Ca2+ current. Acute intravenous administration of TRH to rats with ischemic cardiomyopathy caused a significant increase in heart rate, mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume, and cardiac contractility. TRH in the range of 0.1 - 10 mumol/l was found to exert a positive inotropic effect on cardiac contractility.

Q: Proteomic analyses need prior knowledge of the organism complete genome. Is the complete genome of the bacteria of the genus Arthrobacter available?
Reference: Yes, the complete genome sequence of Arthrobacter (two strains) is deposited in GenBank.
No RAG: As of July 2023, the complete genomes of some Arthrobacter species are available. Scientists have sequenced the genomes of various Arthrobacter strains, which has provided valuable information for understanding their genetic makeup, metabolic capabilities, and evolutionary relationships. This genomic data is crucial for proteomic analyses and other molecular studies of Arthrobacter bacteria. So, the answer is yes.

Q: What is the structural fold of bromodomain proteins?
Reference: The structure fold of the bromodomains is an all-alpha-helical fold, which includes a left-handed four-helix bundle topology, with two short additional helices in a long connecting loop.
No RAG: Bromodomain proteins typically have a conserved structural fold known as the bromodomain fold.

The bromodomain is composed of a bundle of four alpha helices, which form a hydrophobic core. The helices are arranged in a specific orientation such that they create a binding pocket on the surface of the protein. This pocket is lined with amino acid residues that are important for recognizing and binding to acetylated lysine residues on target proteins.

The binding of bromodomains to acetylated lysines is crucial for various biological processes, including gene regulation, chromatin remodeling, and signal transduction. By interacting with acetylated histones or other proteins, bromodomain-containing proteins can influence chromatin structure, gene expression, and protein-protein interactions.

Overall, the bromodomain fold provides a specific structural framework for bromodomain proteins to interact with acetylated lysine residues and play important roles in cellular functions.

It's important to note that there can be some variations in the exact structure and properties of bromodomains among different proteins, but the core four-alpha-helix fold is a common feature. Additionally, bromodomains can sometimes be found in combination with other protein domains, further expanding their functional capabilities.

If you need more detailed or specific information about bromodomain protein structure, it may be beneficial to refer to scientific literature, research articles, or textbooks on protein structure and molecular biology.
With RAG: The bromodomain proteins typically have an all-alpha-helical fold. However, in the ZA loop region of the BRG1 protein, a small beta-sheet was observed for the first time. The Brg1 bromodomain conserves the left-handed, four-helix bundle topology found in other bromodomain structures. There are significant differences in loop regions, especially in the ZA loop where a two amino acids insertion is involved in an uncommon pi-helix termed piD. The 2.1 angstrom crystal structure of the double bromodomain reveals two side-by-side, four-helix bundles with a highly polarized surface charge distribution and has a left-handed four-helix bundle topology, with two short additional helices in a long connecting loop.
